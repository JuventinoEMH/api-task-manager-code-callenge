>[!TIP]
> I decided to separate the logic from the controllers a bit to work with different Laravel functionalities 
> and make the code sections more modular. 
> I created some policies to allow creating or deleting projects 
> and implemented methods like FormRequest for the update and destroy methods  think this was a good 
> decision since it ensures that the user making the request has the proper permissions to perform the action.
> I used database relationships to maintain consistency between tables. 
> I structured the project according to the clientâ€™s needs, ensuring its integrity and security.
> I learned many things, and it was a great experience to improve my skills.
